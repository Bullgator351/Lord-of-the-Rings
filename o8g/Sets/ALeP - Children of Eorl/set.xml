Brightmane!” called Gálmód. “The king’s own horses. But where is their liege, Felaróf the Mighty?”&#10;The orc hefted his mass onto the stallion called Flinthoof. Brightmane, wild-eyed and bucking, jerked away from the orc and galloped for the hills.&#10;“Let us rout them,” said one of the heroes. “For the blood of horses!

Perhaps then we can uncover the truth behind the traitors who surrendered the beacon at Erelas. The sigil of the red field and white stallion.”&#10;The heroes and their companions were greeted well in Aldburg, where they feasted and slept for the first time in what felt like years. It was there they met Ealdwulf, one of the most powerful nobles in Rohan and chief advisor to the young Marshal Éomund.&#10;“Your warnings are dire,” said Ealdwulf, sipping wine from a golden goblet. The fire crackled in his feasting-hall as the heroes and their companions conferred. “And they are appreciated. The Marshal will hear of this immediately, and my éored will ride at first dawn to the Anduin. They will not rest until they have avenged the sullying of our land. It is this other matter which concerns me,” he said. “Traitors amongst us. I have some thoughts on the matter, for the white horse on a red field is no strange symbol to the men of Aldburg.
